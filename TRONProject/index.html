                                <h3> First Credit Card: Discover It Student Cashback </h3>
                                <p> The first credit card is one you NEVER want to close and therefore <br /> 
                                    I chose the Discover It because of its 5% Cashback rotating categories.
                                    I absolutely <br /> recommend this card to first time users because of its <br />
                                    low point of entry and people who need a card with the 5% cashback.
                                </p>

                                <h3> BofA Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card </h3>
                                <p> This is a great credit card I chose to be a buffer between my <br /> 
                                    next choices of credit cards. I use this card specifically for the <br /> 
                                    3% cashback on Online Purchases, a feature no other card I have can do. 
                                    It works well <br /> for when I order items on the internet. Only issue is BofA can <br />
                                    deny you of credit card increases and this card can be a pain to keep. 
                                </p>

                                <h3> Chase Freedom Unlimited & Flex</h3>
                                <p> Chase is the best credit card company that currently exists with <br /> 
                                    the Freedom Unlimited and Flex being the two best cards every person needs! <br />
                                    The Unlimited is a great 1.5% cashback everyday spender's card that allows <br />
                                    users to rack up cashback rewards on all purchases. The Flex is a great card <br />
                                    similar to the Discover It that has rotating 5% cashback categories.
                                </p>

                                <h3>American Express Gold</h3>
                                <p> The AMEX Gold card was a card I picked up for the sole purpose of being <br />
                                    the card I used for dining and purchases for food. Since I love food, I <br />
                                    got this card for the $120 Uber and $120 Seamless annual credit alongside <br />
                                    many rewards that made this card worth it. Although it now has a hefty annual fee <br />
                                    of $325, the $240 annual credits + $100 Resy credit makes it worth it in my opinion. 
                                </p>
