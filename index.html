                        <p>
                            Wage disparity in prisons is a major issue, with inmates earning extremely low wages for their
                             labor. By using PrisonCoin, we can combat pay disparities and ensure 
                            prisoners are paid fairly, resulting in a better working environment.

                        <p>
                            A cryptocurrency system could bring transparency, ensuring all payments between prisons 
                            and inmates are tracked, reducing exploitation. This would create a fairer, more accountable system 
                            for compensating prisoners' work.

                    receive benefits, even while incarcerated. We believe in the dignity of work and that everyone deserves to be 
                    compensated justly, regardless of their circumstances. Our innovative technology seeks to bring transparency and 
                    fairness into the prison system, ensuring that inmates are treated with respect and their labor is valued. Through 
                    PrisonCoin, we aim to create a more equitable environment, fostering hope and opportunity for all prisoners.
